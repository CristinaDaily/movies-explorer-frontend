Movies Explorer is a web application with both frontend and backend components. The frontend, which is the focus of this repository, provides the user interface for interacting with the application. The backend handles data storage, authentication, and other server-side functionalities. You can find the backend repository here: https://github.com/CristinaDaily/movies-explorer-api
